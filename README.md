## Overview

Blazor is a modern front-end web framework part of the .NET platform based on HTML, CSS, and C# that helps you build web apps faster.

## Why Blazor?

This framework allows us to build our entire web app from the front end to the back end using a single development stack. It has a component-based architecture. A Blazor component is a reusable piece of web UI that encapsulates its rendering and UI event handling logic. You can create your own components, but Blazor also provides many built-in components for various use cases.

In Blazor, components can be rendered from both the server and the client to deliver the best possible web app experience. Depending on the interactivity required, different components or even pages within the same application can be rendered from the server, the client, or a combination of both.

Blazor is not limited to web applications; it is also capable of building native mobile and desktop apps through a hybrid approach known as Blazor Hybrid, blending native and web technologies.
